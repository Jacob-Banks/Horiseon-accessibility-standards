Updating Horiseon's web page so that it has a codebase that follows accessibility standards, and therefor is optimized for search engines. Css has been conslidated.

This is a single page website, using HTML and CSS

- Has a header with 3 intrapage links
- Has 2 main sections. The first contains services offered. The second contains benefits provided.
- And lastly a footer with the company's tradmark
- the site is not designed for mobile devices. ie non-repsonsive design.
