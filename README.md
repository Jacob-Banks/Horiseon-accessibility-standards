Updating Horiseon's web page so that it has a codebase that follows accessibility standards, and therefore is optimized for search engines. Css has been consolidated.

This is a single page website, using HTML and CSS

- Has a header with 3 intra page links
- Has 2 main sections. The first contains services offered. The second contains benefits provided.
- And lastly a footer with the company's trademark
- the site is not designed for mobile devices. ie non-responsive design.
